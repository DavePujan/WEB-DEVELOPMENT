docker pull ubuntu:latest
Docker tries to pull the latest Ubuntu image from Docker Hub

use of ps command:
1.You ran an interactive Ubuntu container
docker run -it ubuntu:latest

2.Then, inside the container, you ran:
ps -elf
This showed the running processes in the container: then use ctrl + PQ to exit container
ex:
PID 1: /bin/bash (the shell you're in)
PID 9: ps -elf (the process you just ran)

3.You ran docker ps again from the host
docker ps
This time, Docker showed one running container:
ex:
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE           COMMAND       CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
5d1a64bbdb39   ubuntu:latest   "/bin/bash"   24 seconds ago   Up 23 seconds             determined_tesla


exec command:
# Start a container
docker run -dit --name mytest ubuntu

# Exec into it
docker exec -it mytest bash
# Now you're inside the container shell

The docker exec command runs a new command inside an existing, running container.

üß† When to Use docker exec:
Use Case	Example
Get a shell into a container	docker exec -it mycontainer bash
Run a one-time command	docker exec mycontainer ls /app
Debug something inside a running app	docker exec -it mycontainer top
Inspect environment	docker exec mycontainer env

üîç Difference from Other Commands
Command	Purpose
docker run	Starts a new container and runs a command
docker exec	Runs a new command inside an existing, running container
docker attach	Connects to the main process of a running container

stop container:
docker stop vigilant_borg

remove container:
docker rm vigilant_borg

Step-by-Step: Pull Image ‚Üí Start ‚Üí Attach ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Stop ‚Üí Delete
‚úÖ 1. Pull a Docker Image
docker pull ubuntu
‚úÖ 2. Start a Container from the Image
docker run -dit --name mycontainer ubuntu
‚úÖ 3. Attach to the Running Container (Optional)
If you want to connect to its main shell:
docker attach mycontainer
‚ö†Ô∏è Pressing Ctrl+C here will stop the container. Use Ctrl+P, Ctrl+Q to safely detach.

‚úÖ 4. Execute a Command Inside the Container
docker exec -it mycontainer bash
Now you're in a shell inside the container.

You can run commands like:
ps -elf
apt update
Or just:
docker exec mycontainer echo "Hello from inside!"
‚úÖ 5. Stop the Container
docker stop mycontainer
‚úÖ 6. Delete (Remove) the Container
docker rm mycontainer
üîÅ If the container is still running, you can force removal with:
docker rm -f mycontainer


The Dockerfile is a plain-text document that tells Docker how to build the app and
dependencies into a Docker image.

port mapping:
docker run -it -p 1025:1025 mailhog/mailhog 

Port mapping connects a port on the host machine to a port on a container, allowing external traffic to reach services running inside the container.

docker run -p <host_port>:<container_port> <image>
Example:
docker run -p 8080:80 nginx
