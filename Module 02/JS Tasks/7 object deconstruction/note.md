# üéÅ JavaScript Object Destructuring: Renaming & Defaults

Hey friend\! The code snippet you're seeing is a fantastic way to test if you've moved past basic variable declarations and are comfortable with **Object Destructuring**, a feature that makes code cleaner and more readable. It combines several key concepts into one line\!

Master this, and you'll show you're writing modern, idiomatic JavaScript\! Good luck tomorrow\! üöÄ

## 1\. What is Object Destructuring? (The Theory)

**Object Destructuring** is a syntax that allows you to unwrap properties from objects into distinct variables. It simplifies accessing and using object properties, especially when you need only a few specific fields.

### The Basic Syntax

```javascript
const user = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
const { name, age } = user; // Creates two new variables: 'name' and 'age'
// console.log(name); // Output: "Alice"
```

The key here is that the variable names **must** match the property keys in the object (`name` matches `name`).

## 2\. The Advanced Code Breakdown (Renaming and Defaults)

The core of the interview question lies in this single line:

```javascript
const { firstName: fName = "New Script", lastName: lName = "Style" } = person;
```

This single line is doing three things at once:

1.  **Destructuring:** Pulling properties out of the `person` object.
2.  **Renaming:** Mapping the original property key to a new local variable name.
3.  **Default Value:** Specifying a value to use if the property is missing from the object.

### The Rules of the Syntax:

| Syntax Piece | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `firstName` | The **key** (property name) we are looking for in the source object (`person`). |
| `:` | The separator indicating a **rename** is coming next. |
| `fName` | The **new local variable name** that will hold the property's value. |
| `=` | The separator indicating a **default value** is coming next. |
| `"New Script"` | The **default value** to use if `person.firstName` is `undefined` or not present. |

### üß† Dry Run: Execution Flow

Let's break down the execution with the source object:

```javascript
const person = { firstName: 'The script'};
```

| Property Check | Destructuring Syntax | Step 1: Check `person` | Step 2: Use Default? | Final Variable |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`firstName`** | `firstName: fName = "New Script"` | **Found.** Value is `'The script'`. | **No.** Value is present, so the default is ignored. | `fName` = `'The script'` |
| **`lastName`** | `lastName: lName = "Style"` | **Not Found.** Value is `undefined`. | **Yes.** Value is missing, so use the default. | `lName` = `'Style'` |

### ‚ùå Output Analysis

1.  `console.log(fName);` prints: **`The script`**
2.  `console.log(lName);` prints: **`Style`**

The actual output in the image confirms this: `'The script'` and `'Style'`.

## 3\. Interview Questions on Destructuring

Be ready to explain not just the syntax, but *why* it's useful.

### ‚ùì Question 1:

**What is the difference between Array Destructuring and Object Destructuring?**

**üí° Answer:**

  * **Object Destructuring** (uses `{}`): The order doesn't matter, but the variable names must match the property **keys** (unless renamed).
      * Example: `const { age, name } = user;`
  * **Array Destructuring** (uses `[]`): The order **is important**. The variable names are assigned based on the element's **position** in the array.
      * Example: `const [first, second] = [10, 20];`

### ‚ùì Question 2:

**How do you rename a destructured variable without using a default value?**

**üí° Answer:**
You use the colon `:` syntax, omitting the equals sign.

```javascript
const book = { title: "Moby Dick", author: "Herman Melville" };
const { title: bookTitle } = book; // Renames 'title' to 'bookTitle'
console.log(bookTitle); // "Moby Dick"
```

### ‚ùì Question 3:

**Can you destructure nested properties? If so, show an example.**

**üí° Answer:**
Yes, you can use nested object literals in the destructuring pattern.

```javascript
const config = {
  db: {
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 5432
  }
};

// Destructure host from the nested db object
const { db: { host } } = config; 
console.log(host); // "localhost"
```

## 4\. More Example Code Questions with Outputs

| Code Snippet | Output | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `const a = { x: 1 }; const { y = 5, x } = a; console.log(x, y);` | `1 5` | `x` is found, so no default. `y` is missing/undefined, so the default $5$ is used. |
| `const a = { x: null }; const { x = 5 } = a; console.log(x);` | `null` | The default is **only** used if the property is **missing** or its value is **`undefined`**. `null` is a defined value, so the default $5$ is ignored. |
| `const a = { x: 1 }; const { x: renamedX, z: renamedZ = 10 } = a; console.log(renamedX, renamedZ);` | `1 10` | `x` is renamed to `renamedX`. `z` is missing and uses the default $10$. |
| `const a = [1, 2, 3]; const [one, , three] = a; console.log(one, three);` | `1 3` | Array destructuring uses commas to skip the element at index $1$. |
| `const a = { x: 1 }; const { x, ...rest } = a; console.log(rest);` | `{}` | The **rest** pattern collects all *remaining* properties into a new object (`rest`). In this case, there are no remaining properties. |
