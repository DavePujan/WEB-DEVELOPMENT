Core Lib: react , react-dm , react-native

Basic installation:

npx create-react-app name-of-folder
executer + utility

you can use npm run start
or npm run build : when you use build , the build folder was served to user in production , not src folder, build folder will have html css js which is converted version of your react app code.

installation with vite:
npm create vite@latest
cd 01-vite-react-app
npm install
npm run dev

now delete this files(unwanted) : src:setupTests.js , src:reportWebVitals.js , src:logo.svg , src:appTest.js ,{ src:app.css, src:index.js } ( if you want to)
